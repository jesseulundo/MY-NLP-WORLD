# MY-NLP-WORLD
This repository has different NLP projects and techniques that I have worked with on my previous experiences.
Thou the data differs from the direct work, here is where I made my experiences with various types of dataset. 

# TOPIC MODELING
Topic Modeling serves the purpose of extracting various distinguishing concepts or topics from a large corpus
that has various types of documents and each document talks about one or more concepts. 
Looking into customers complains from a specific web application, there is a need of knowing what are the main 
complains that the customers are having. If this would be applied using man power it will take days or even months 
for humans to analyzed a large amount of documents and identify their main topics. 
In This project I am using Topic Modeling an Unsupervised Machine learning approach to be able to determine the main
clusters or topics being discussed on Machicon Japan's events.

For this I have used:
  Latent Semantic Indexing; 
  Latent Dirichlet Allocation;
